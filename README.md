# Dylsons-Genius-Refactor-HW1
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. Such code will ensure peoples with disabilities can access their website using assistive technologies. It is in the businesses best interest to incorporate these traits as search engines favor such websites and thus allow their firm to gain more exposure in the world wide web.
